## PREPARE

### Load needed packages

``` {r}
library("tidyverse")
library("janitor")
library("lubridate")
library("hms")
```

### Import data sets [(Source)](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)

``` {r}
jul_2021 <- read.csv("202107-divvy-tripdata.csv")
aug_2021 <- read.csv("202108-divvy-tripdata.csv")
sep_2021 <- read.csv("202109-divvy-tripdata.csv")
oct_2021 <- read.csv("202110-divvy-tripdata.csv")
nov_2021 <- read.csv("202111-divvy-tripdata.csv")
dec_2021 <- read.csv("202112-divvy-tripdata.csv")
jan_2022 <- read.csv("202201-divvy-tripdata.csv")
feb_2022 <- read.csv("202202-divvy-tripdata.csv")
mar_2022 <- read.csv("202203-divvy-tripdata.csv")
apr_2022 <- read.csv("202204-divvy-tripdata.csv")
may_2022 <- read.csv("202205-divvy-tripdata.csv")
jun_2022 <- read.csv("202206-divvy-tripdata.csv")
```

### Check if data sets can be merged

``` {r}
compare_df_cols_same(
  jul_2021,
  aug_2021,
  sep_2021,
  oct_2021,
  nov_2021,
  dec_2021,
  jan_2022,
  feb_2022,
  mar_2022,
  apr_2022,
  may_2022,
  jun_2022,
  bind_method = c("bind_rows", "rbind"),
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

### Merge all data sets

``` {r}
cyclistic  <- rbind (
  jul_2021,
  aug_2021,
  sep_2021,
  oct_2021,
  nov_2021,
  dec_2021,
  jan_2022,
  feb_2022,
  mar_2022,
  apr_2022,
  may_2022,
  jun_2022
)
```

### Inspect new data set

``` {r}
summary(cyclistic)
```

## PROCESS

### Remove geographical indication contained in columns 9 to 12

``` {r}
cyclistic <- cyclistic[ -c(9:12) ]
```

### Check for duplicates

``` {r}
length(unique(cyclistic$ride_id)) == nrow(cyclistic)
#use "cyclistic <- distinct(cyclistic)" to remove duplicates
```

### Remove rows contating NA and NULL values

``` {r}
cyclistic[cyclistic == '' ] <- NA
cyclistic<- na.omit(cyclistic)
```

### Check for misspelled strings/categories

``` {r}
unique(cyclistic$rideable_type)
unique(cyclistic$member_casual)
```

### Convert character to datetime

``` {r}
cyclistic$started_at <- as.POSIXct(cyclistic$started_at, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
cyclistic$ended_at <- as.POSIXct(cyclistic$ended_at, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
```

### Calculate ride length

``` {r}
cyclistic$ride_length <- difftime(cyclistic$ended_at, cyclistic$started_at, units = "mins")
cyclistic$ride_length <- round(cyclistic$ride_length, digits = 2)
```

### Remove negative and/or zero ride lengths

``` {r}
cyclistic <- subset(cyclistic, ride_length > 0)
```

### Create new date columns

``` {r}
cyclistic$month <- format(as.Date(cyclistic$started_at), "%m")
cyclistic$day <- format(as.Date(cyclistic$started_at), "%d")
cyclistic$year <- format(as.Date(cyclistic$started_at), "%Y")
cyclistic$weekday <- format(as.Date(cyclistic$started_at), "%A")
cyclistic$time <- as_hms((cyclistic$started_at))
cyclistic$hour <- as_hms(floor_date(cyclistic$started_at, unit = "hour"))
```

### Order weekday

``` {r}
cyclistic$weekday <- ordered(cyclistic$weekday, levels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))
```

### Save new data set

``` {r}
write.csv(cyclistic, "cyclistic.csv")
```
